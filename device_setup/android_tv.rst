AndroidTVs have custom ROMs that can be flashed that enable the box to be quickly rooted and configured. These ROMs come in two architectures, 32bit and 64bit. Niantic had previously committed to dropping 32bit support so plan accordingly for the ATV that will be purchased.

 * Download the correct ROM for the device. Refer to `Download ROM <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-ATV/wiki#download-rom>`_ for more information.
    * 32bit ROMs are generic while 64bit ROMs are device-specific
