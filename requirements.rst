Requirements
============

MAD requires the following things to be installed available on your server:

- A server/computer running Linux. RaspberryPis do work, but aren't recommended
- A 64-bit CPU for MAD is also highly recommended since some optional parts of MAD do require to run on 64-bit. It does have a fallback for 32-bit CPUs though
- MariaDB server (MySQL has some issues and is not recommended)
- Python 3.6 (or higher) and Python's package manager command line tool :code:`pip`
- A rooted Android device being able to run the game. See `this list <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-device-list>`_ of tested devices
- It's not required but highly recommended to use Python's `virtualenv` to install dependencies. Have a look at `this <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>` and `this <https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/>` if you're new to `virtualenv`
